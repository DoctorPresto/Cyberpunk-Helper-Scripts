# Cyberpunk-Helper-Scripts

scripts to help automate troubleshooting and other tasks for modding cyberpunk 2077.

FindAllErrors.bat - updated or version 2.12a
USAGE:
Simply place the file in your install directory or drag and drop your Cyberpunk 2077 folder on top of the .bat wherever
it may be. The script will dig through the folder
for logs, extract any error messages and print them to a new file called FilteredLogs.txt for easy troubleshooting.
